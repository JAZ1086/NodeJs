# Middleware in Express

Middleware in Express are functions that come into play after the server receives the request and before the response is sent to the client. They are arranged in a chain and are called in sequence.

We can use middleware functions for different types of processing tasks required for fulfilling the request like database querying, making API calls, preparing the response, etc, and finally calling the next middleware function in the chain.

Middleware functions take three arguments: the request object (request), the response object (response), and optionally the next() middleware function
